# Dim Bulb Tester

My version of a dim bulb tester. This unit uses four salt lamp / fridge bulbs because it's very difficult to get standard sized incandescant bulbs in Australia. These are easily available in a range of values up to 40 watt.

Four switches let you easily set the maximum wattage of the bulb set. A bypass switch it provided to allow quickly switching between dim bulb and straight power.
